            <h1>Part One</h1>
            <p>
                One could say I was born with a blindfold on and never knew anything different. I was a “Child of The Corporation”; that’s what they called my generation: “Children of the Corporation”. Yea… we had a bright future ahead of us. My name, as is recorded in the central DB, is Seventy Five. My friends call me Seventy, or at least they would if I had a chance to make any. At the very least, Seventy is my username on several apps, and I have a few chat bots configured to refer to me that way too. So long story short, I’m a bit lonely. Other than a cat and a decent show I’m streaming right now, I don’t get exposed to much social activity. I’m not exactly looking to meet anyone right now, but, full disclosure, I do have a tab open to the latest dating app on my monitor. Although, let's not get ahead of ourselves, I haven’t felt the need to make an account yet. I’m just checking out the landing page. This site claims “there’s a match out there for everyone”. They claim their algorithm will “find you a match in O(N) time” - whatever that means. Sounds like it would be pretty fast though. But, I imagine there could be a lot of single people out there too 🤔. Well, before signing up, let’s just check how fast their algorithm could run…
            </p>
            <p>

                I imagine they use one integer to represent each user on the app, and two compatible people could be stored as the sum of the two integers, I mean people, in the relationship. So, let's suppose I was looking for two people that summed to some target relationship integer, how long would I (or not me but someone else using the site) have to wait for a match?
