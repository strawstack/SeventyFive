            <h1>Part Four</h1>
            <p>
                I pulled my headset off, left my apartment, and took the elevator to the rooftop lounge. Sometimes “augmented” reality just wasn’t real enough, but that’s something you’d already know even forever ago in your time. Maybe you think if it “gets good enough” we could spend all our time augmented, and maybe you’re right, but, as of yet at least, it’s not good enough. From the rooftop lounge, one could see the waterfront: several blocks away over the tops of shorter buildings and a multi-story mall, but it could still be seen, so it showed up in my rent. There was a waterfront path down there between the mall and the water. It got really narrow in places, but, for a good stretch, it was really wide and nice. There used to be a four lane highway right alongside the whole path. That road became a parking lot when cars became self-driving then a very long mall when cars started flying. I liked it as a mall. I could ignore it easily enough. A couple weeks ago - wow has it been that long since I was last down there - I walked along the stretch of waterfront path closest to my place. I felt a bit squished between the mall and the water in places, but I got used to it quickly, and I really started to enjoy the open courtyards with trees, benches, and ponds, and, in the narrower segments, the lighting was well done, and it felt cozy and safe. There was a lot of security - the right amount of security. And, one had to pay a monthly fee to use the pathway. If you didn’t pay, you had to stay inside the mall; you could still see the waterfront, and walk parallel to it for the most part, but people in the mall kept trying to get your attention, so I paid the fee.
            </p>
            <p>
                Paying the fee also means I get to vote on upcoming projects. The next project was a cool spa-bathhouse which would be built between two of the many piers that stuck out into the water from the pathway. Most of the piers were just flat parks with winding paths. A few piers had businesses, or the remnants of old-world businesses.
            </p>
            <p>
                The bathhouse was to be built between any two piers on the waterfront, and the vote asked which two piers should be selected. Construction would connect the two piers together such that the rectangle of water between the two piers and the waterfront path would be enclosed. The enclosed water would be heated for the baths, and structures for massages, lounges, tea rooms, pathways, and restaurants would be built over top of the water.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wanted a bathhouse, and I wanted it to be big, so, for my vote, I wanted to select the two piers that would contain the largest rectangle of water. As I walked along the pathway, I collected the lengths and positions of each pier, which I represented as an array of integers. When I returned home, I calculated which two piers I should vote for…
