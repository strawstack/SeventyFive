            <p>
                I missed my stop once. On the train. Too tired from a long work day - or actually I was on my way to a job interview; it was a long time ago now. I’d been studying for the interview pretty hard. Anyways, I fell asleep, and, when I finally woke up, the next stop was just a single lowercase letter… weird. I felt rested though. The next stop was a different lowercase letter. The seats on the train were padded benches, and there wasn’t anyone else in this train car. What if everyone lived in small apartments chained together and mobile. I shook my head. I had to find my stop. The train stopped again: another single lowercase letter for a stop name. As we started moving again, the announcement speaker came on with a crackle:

                “Attention passengers - the train system has encountered a rare malfunction in which all the stops on the line have separated into multiple stops where each stop is a single letter from the original stop name. This issue typically resolves in O(n^2) time where n is the sum of the number of letters in all stop names. However, several stops were added recently, and the train appears to be running out of memory while trying to reboot. Please be patient while we attempt to resolve this issue…”

                That didn’t sound good to me. O(n^2) time didn’t sound right either. The train system was linear: one stop after another? This could be fixed faster for sure. Maybe I couldn’t fix the train system itself, but I should be able to figure out where my stop is in this mess. My stop name was hard to remember, but I think it was “lflwobvwawjyqtzqocrbjmxxwkxmawy” or something? I never bothered to learn what it actually was. I just knew it because the stop before contained no repeating letters and that one was “vykmawshjlcfrqedtnpxui” - at least I think that’s what it was? I didn’t remember the exact letters. Anyways, it was the longest stop name with no repeating letters: I knew that for sure. All I had to do was watch each station go by one letter at a time until I’d found the longest sequence with no repeating characters, and the next stop would be mine! Armed with that info and 20% battery left on my headset, I’d make it to my job interview in no time!

                That was forever ago. Funny I still have the memory. I did make it to the job interview by the way, and I got the job. Oddly, the interviewer asked me the exact same question I’d solved on my headset on the train. It was something like…
