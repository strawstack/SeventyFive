            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>SeventyFive is a fictional story written by me (<a href="https://richard.dev" class="link">richard</a>) inspired by <a href="https://leetcode.com/list/xi4ci4ig/" class="link">this list</a> of common technical interview problems. The intent of this website is to add a bit of fun to what can otherwise becomes a multi-week souless grid through seventy-five problems.</p>

            <h2>How and Why to Cheat</h2>

            <p>It's intended that you solve one part each day. However, if you want to view the next part before it unlocks, you can! One way to accomplish this is to edit the save data that this site relies on in your browsers local storage. This site stores timestamp and parts completed as a JSON object in your browser's localStorage under the key <span class="stand">sf</span>. Change the timestamp to some date in the past and problems will unlock accordingly. Editing the data in localStorage is also a good way to restore lost progress.</p>

            <h2>Why You Shouldn't Cheat</h2>

            <p>Now that you know how to cheat, let's not get carried away. This site is about having fun and increasing your programing skill. One problem a day is more than fast enough. Rushing ahead will only increase the chance that you'll burn out, and/or decrease the quality of the code you write. Jumping ahead to read to story will only cause you to realize much sooner that I'm not the best writter, and there's no climax or payoff in the end.</p>

            <h2>What You Should Do Instead of Cheating</h2>

            <p>Enjoy the story as you wish each day, or skip it and just do the problem. Spend your down time between problems reflecting on the story <span class="shade">(there's no deep meaning, but maybe you'll get inspired to write something of your own)</span>, or reflect on your solution: can you make it faster? more memory efficient? more <span class="shade">(or less)</span> readible? Take a break if you feel like it, and even if you don't; once a problem unlocks it will be unlocked forever, so there's no rush. If you think through a solution, and understand the code you write, you'll be fast when it counts ;)</p>
